# Recommendation Systems Exhibition
An exhibition of recommendation systems used on the MovieLens dataset, as guided by Chapter 14: Recommender Systems in [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recommender-systems/index.html).  I convert the modules in the book from mxnet to PyTorch, which requires me to fully understand not only the interworkings of PyTorch but the theory of the models as well.
