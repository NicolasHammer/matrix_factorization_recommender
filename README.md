# Recommendation Systems Exhibition
An exhibition of recommendation systems used on the MovieLens dataset, as guided by Chapter 14: Recommender Systems in [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recommender-systems/index.html). I convert the modules in the book from mxnet to PyTorch, which requires me to fully understand not only the interworkings of PyTorch but the theory of the models as well.

## Installation Instructions
Please work in a virtual environment in Python 3.9. To create the virtual environment, run the following command (on Unix/macOS):
```
python3.9 -m venv env
